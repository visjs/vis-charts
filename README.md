# vis-charts

**This is a "pug'n & play replacement" for [vis](https://github.com/almende/vis), wich is no longer maintained**

Vis.js is a dynamic, browser based visualization library.
The library is designed to be easy to use, handle large amounts
of dynamic data, and enable manipulation of the data.
The library consists of the following components:

- [DataSet and DataView](https://github.com/visjs/vis-data). A flexible key/value based data set. Add, update, and
  remove items. Subscribe on changes in the data set. A DataSet can filter and
  order items, and convert fields of items. A filtered and/or formatted view on a DataSet.
- [Network](https://github.com/visjs/vis-network). Display a network (force directed graph) with nodes and edges.
- [Timeline and Graph2d](https://github.com/visjs/vis-timeline). Display different types of data on a timeline.
- [Graph3d](https://github.com/visjs/vis-graph3d). Display data in a three dimensional graph.

**This version of the original [vis](https://github.com/almende/vis) library is based on the lates state of the [`develop` branch (320b18), from 20.02.2019](https://github.com/almende/vis/commit/320b1809fcbdf1d281e54ab8baa3daf84a1f358b) and started therefore as an improved version 4.21. From there on we developed this repository further. You are welcome to help!**
